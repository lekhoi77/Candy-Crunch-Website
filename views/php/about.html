                <div class="story-description">
                    Our founder grew up around handcrafted street candies that weren’t perfect,
                    but always carried a sense of innocence and laughter. Years later, in a market
                    filled with industrial products, that feeling was gone. The absence of emotional
                    delight inspired the creation of Candy Crunch — a brand designed to bring back
                    the small, vibrant moments of happiness a single candy can create.

                            Our founder began experimenting with crunchy candy at home, aiming to create 
                            a clean, joyful “crunch” sound that could brighten someone’s day.

                            After many failed attempts, two signature flavors emerged: Grape Pop and Strawberry Burst. 
                            Family and friends loved them immediately.
